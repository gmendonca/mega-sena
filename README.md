# mega-sena

Lottery data analysis based on the Brazilian's Lottery [Mega Sena](http://loterias.caixa.gov.br/wps/portal/loterias/landing/megasena/). I tried to make it generic as possible. However I'm still depending on the file provided by Mega Sena about past draws to get to some conclusions. I'm also using the implementation provided in this [article](http://jaguar.fcav.unesp.br/RME/fasciculos/v31/v31_n4/A7_RGiarelli.pdf), to get some insights. It still need a lot of improvements, however it can be used at least for checking if the number was already draw and some other statistics. The `MEGA_SENA` file provided is not always updated, so if you want the newest possible, download from the website.

You can download an updated version from [here](http://www1.caixa.gov.br/loterias/_arquivos/loterias/D_megase.zip)

## TODOs

- Chance of winning doesn't consider all sequences when choosing more than `max_guess`
- Chance of winning is not well built. It need better calculations. Eg.: Consider the expected draws and actual draws using the color lottery theory described in the article.
- Machine Learning

## Requirements

You need Python and pip. Then, you can install the requirements with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```
Usage: python process.py [OPTIONS]
Tries to get a better chance of winning mega sena.
   -f, --file                     Mega Sena file name
   -q, --quantity                 The total of numbers available to be draw, defaults to 60
   -m, --max                      Total of draw numbers, defaults to 6.
   -h, --howmany                  Number of possible 6 numbers to be draw with higher probability
```

## Examples

```
$ python process.py -f "MEGA_SENA" 12 34 45 53 55 58
